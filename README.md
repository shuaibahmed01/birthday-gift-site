## About the Site

This birthday gift site was a project I developed to put to the test and apply my HTML & CSS knowledge. I was motivated to create this as my friends birthday was coming up and wanted to practice making him a website, so what better practice than to user Elvis Presley! To create the site I utlized many different core HTML & CSS concepts including display options (block, in-line, flexbox, etc.), styling options(font-weight, color, background, etc.), and experimenting with fun concepts like the gradient and hover features!
